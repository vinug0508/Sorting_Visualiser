Sorting Visualizer

-> Implemented five core sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort) in JavaScript to demonstrate proficiency in algorithm design and complexity analysis.

-> Engineered a dynamic front-end using HTML/CSS to visually represent algorithm execution steps (comparison, swap, overwrite) for intuitive learning.

-> Integrated the Gemini API to introduce an interactive learning feature, providing generative, on-demand algorithm explanations and multiple-choice quizzes.

-> Developed a user control panel enabling dynamic adjustment of array size, animation speed (latency), and custom array input, showcasing practical UI/UX development.

-> Incorporated real-time performance tracking of key metrics (Comparisons and Swaps) to empirically evaluate and display the time complexity of different algorithms.
